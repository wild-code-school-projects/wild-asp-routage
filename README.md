Learning how routage work using ASP

# Challenge Objectives

## Objective:
Set up an ASP.Net application with specific functionality and routing configurations.

## Details:
- Initialize a project in Visual Studio 2019 as an ASP.Net Core project with REST API and controllers.
- Implement a controller class named `HelloController` with two actions: `YellHello` and `SayHello`.
- Configure routes for accessing the actions via two different methods:
  1. Conventional route: {controller}/{action}
  2. Attribute route: Declare routes different from the conventional route.

## Validation Criteria:
1. The project's base is created using Visual Studio 2019 with the specified configurations.
2. Provide a link to a GitHub repository containing the solution to the challenge.
3. Copy and paste the `HelloController` class into the file `/Controllers/HelloController.cs`.
4. Ensure that:
   - Both actions `Yell` and `Say` are accessible via the conventional route.
   - Both actions `Yell` and `Say` are accessible via the attribute route with different routes compared to the conventional route.
